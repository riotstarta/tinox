// libFuzzer harness for HTTP/2 frame reading
// (crates/tinox-core/http2_server/Http2Server.tnx::readFrame, RFC 7540
// §4.1). Deferred in earlier revisions of fuzz/README.md as "meaningfully
// bigger" because readFrame() is an *instance* method needing a
// constructed Http2Server (routes, middleware, socket state) plus an
// Http2Conn (streams map, HPACK dynamic tables) rather than a free
// function like Amqp091::readFrame -- but neither constructor actually
// does any I/O or requires real routes/tables to be populated
// (Http2Server::new(port) and Http2Conn::new(handle) are both plain
// struct literals, confirmed by reading both before relying on it here),
// and readFrame() itself only touches `this.readBytes`, which is a thin
// wrapper over the same httpServerReadRawBytes native the amplification
// fix from the AMQP-0-9-1 target (issue #111) also covers server-side.
// So the scope here is exactly the frame-header/payload parsing layer
// this file's sibling targets already parse from, just entered via
// Http2Driver_tinoxHttp2ReadFrame instead of a free function.
//
// One difference from fuzz/amqp091: httpServerReadRawBytes(fd, count)
// (runtime.c) takes a raw fd and calls read() on it directly -- unlike
// httpConnReadN, which goes through a runtime.c TinoxConn* built via
// httpConnFromFd(). So Http2Conn::new(conn)'s `handle` field can be the
// socketpair fd directly; no httpConnFromFd() wrapping step is needed
// here at all.
//
// Bridge: same socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, ...) + shutdown(SHUT_WR)
// technique as fuzz/amqp091/amqp091_fuzzer.cc -- write the whole fuzz
// input into one end, shut it down for writing so the kernel signals EOF
// once the buffered bytes are drained (httpServerReadRawBytes's read()
// loop already treats a `read() <= 0` short/zero result as "stop", see
// runtime.c, not assumed), then read off the other end. No connection
// preface is fed in: readFrame() itself doesn't check for one (that's
// Http2Server::handleConnection's job, one layer up, not exercised by
// this target), so seeds are raw 9-byte-header(+payload) frames, not
// full connections.
