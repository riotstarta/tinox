# Http2Driver.tnx imports the real tinox.core.http2_server module (crates/
# tinox-core-ext/http2_server/*.tnx, an extended-tier stdlib package since
# the core/extended split — see tinox.toml here) and adds a one-line
# tinoxHttp2ReadFrame(conn: Int64) wrapper. No copy of the frame-parsing
# logic. `tinox install` fetches it and its own transitive deps (hpack,
# http_server — see http2_server's own tinox.toml), cached under
# ~/.tinox/repository/ after the first run. `tinox build` always tries to
# link a full executable and fails here because the driver has no
# main()/tinox_main — that failure is expected and harmless, we only need
# the driver_out.ll it leaves behind before the failing final link step.
