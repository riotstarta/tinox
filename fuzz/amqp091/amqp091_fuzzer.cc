// libFuzzer harness for AMQP-0-9-1 frame reading
// (crates/tinox-core/amqp091/Amqp091.tnx::readFrame). Unlike HPACK,
// readFrame() doesn't take a buffer — it reads directly off a "conn"
// handle (a runtime.c TinoxConn* wrapping a socket fd) via httpConnReadN,
// which loops on conn_recv() until it gets N bytes or EOF. So the fuzz
// input can't be handed over as a plain byte array the way
// tinoxHpackDecode's List<Int64> is; it has to look like bytes arriving
// on a real socket.
//
// Bridge: a `socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, ...)`, write the whole fuzz
// input into one end, then `shutdown(SHUT_WR)` that end so the kernel
// signals EOF once the buffered bytes are drained — no feeder thread
// needed, since the input is small enough to fit in the socket's send
// buffer in one non-blocking write (see MAX_INPUT below) and
// httpConnReadN() already treats `conn_recv() <= 0` (EOF or error) as "no
// more data" instead of blocking (runtime.c:2654, `if (got <= 0) break;`)
// — confirmed by reading the source before relying on it here, not
// assumed. amqp091_driver.tnx imports the real crates/tinox-core/amqp091
// module unmodified and adds a one-line wrapper (tinoxAmqp091ReadFrame)
// that takes the already-wrapped conn handle and returns just the
// frameType, so this harness doesn't need to know AmqpFrame091's struct
// layout. build.sh compiles the driver via the real `tinox build` down to
// LLVM IR, then recompiles that IR with ASan + libFuzzer coverage
// instrumentation and links it against an instrumented runtime.c (which
// supplies httpConnFromFd) plus this file — same technique as
// fuzz/hpack, see fuzz/README.md.
